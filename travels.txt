My favorite travel experience was probably the time I went on a two week, self-supported bike tour in the pacific northwest.

We started in Vancouver, rode east for 3 days across the Canadian Rockies, south across the US border, west across the Cascades, took a bunch of ferries to get through the San Juan Islands, Victoria (in Canada), and then to Port Townsend, Bainbridge Island, and finally ending in Seattle.

The trip was 800 miles total with 3 rest days. It was fantastic.
